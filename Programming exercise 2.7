# Get the number of miles driven for the last tank of gas
miles = input('How many miles did you drive on the last tank of gas? ')

# Get the number of gallons of gas used to fill the tank
gallons = input('How many gallons did you use to fill the gas tank? ')

# Calculate the mpg using 'mpg=miles/gallons'
miles_per_gallon = float (miles) / float (gallons)

# Display the result
print('You will have gotten ', miles_per_gallon, 'mpg on your last tank of gas.')
