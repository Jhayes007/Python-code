#   Purpose: To solve the programming exercise 2.5 on distance traveled

# Assign a value to the speed variable.

speed = 60

# Assign a value to the time variable.

time1 = 5
time2 = 8
time3 = 12

# Get the distance traveled.
distance1 = speed * time1

distance2 = speed * time2

distance3 = speed * time3

print("Traveling at 60 miles per hour...")
print("After 5 hours you will have traveled ", distance1, "miles.")
print("After 8 hours you will have traveled ", distance2, "miles.")
print("After 12 hours you will have traveled ", distance3, "miles.")
